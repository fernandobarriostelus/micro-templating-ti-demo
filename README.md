Micro-templating is a concept that refers to the use of minimalistic, lightweight template engines or methods in software development. Unlike traditional, full-fledged templating systems, micro-templating focuses on simplicity and efficiency, often providing just enough functionality to interpolate variables and evaluate simple expressions within templates. This approach is particularly popular in web development and other areas where rendering speed and resource efficiency are critical.
